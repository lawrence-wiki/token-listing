A Sincere Thank You
-------------------
 
To everyone I've had the pleasure of knowing since 2018 or 2021, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude for the trust and support you've given me throughout my previous journey at a top-tier CEX, where I contributed to its growth from a small spot marketplace. Your trust and encouragement, especially during the early days, has meant the world to me. Building a business from the ground up is no small feat, and your support was vital during those formative stages. As I continue my career with Bitget, I remain committed to supporting your business in every way I can. I hope you will have faith and confidence in this fast-growing exchange as we move forward together.
 
  
 
  
 
As a final note, please don't hesitate to report any other issues you encounter on our platform. We are committed to doing our best to improve our services.
 
  
 
Respectfully yours,
